			<h1>Werewolf Chat</h1>
			<p>Yet another end-to-end encryption chat app, however, with post quantum cryptography (the NTRU library) resistant encryption.</p>
			<h3>Whats post quantum cryptography?</h3>
<p>Quantum computing threatens the confiedntiality of several asymmetric algorithms, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a>. Post quantum cryptography uses asymmetric algorthims that are resistant to quantum attack, see wikipedia page  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography">here</a>  </p>

			<h3>Why the name Werewolf?</h3>
<p>Name for the application was chosen for the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrodinger's cat</a> is both dead and alive, therefor the cat is undead.</li>
				<li>If the cat is undead that means it is either a zombie or a vampire.</li>
				<li>Zombies are dumb and vampires are smart.</li>
				<li>Quantum computing cryptanalysis math is confusing at times, therefore it is probably too hard for a zombie.</li>
				<li>Therefore Schrodinger's cat is a vampire. </li>
				<li>Q.E.D.</li>
				</ul>
<p>What do vampires (and also probably cats) not like...</p> 
<p>A Werewolf. Thus the chat app that protects you from Vampire Hacker Cats with end to end post quantum encryption is Werewolf Chat.</p>
